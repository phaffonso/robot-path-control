# robot-path-control
Path control project for the IA368N course (Unicamp)

Written for Octave, but mostly MATLAB-compatible.

pathcontrol.m makes a robot follow a planned path (must be saved in a file). Most of the other source files are auxiliary functions or scripts.

The PathPlan2.m script requires some functions that are not included because they are other people's work. In other words this script won't run if you try. PathPlan2.m itself is Dr. Eleri Cardoso's work with small modifications.
